Sales Analysis Using Power BI

Developed a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI to uncover trends and patterns within the data, enabling more informed and data-driven decision-making. 
This dashboard is designed to streamline the workflow of financial analysts by providing clear and insightful visualizations that highlight key metrics and performance indicators. 
The ultimate aim is to offer a holistic view of the company's financial landscape, making complex data easily accessible and actionable.

Steps to complete this dashboard-

Data Acquisition: Sourced and imported datasets from online platforms, including Coursera, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant data.

Data Modeling: To optimize our reports/dashboard for compatibility and minimize refresh times, I established relationships among tables using a star schema. By designating sales as the fact table and other tables as dimensions, I ensured optimized query performance and maintained data integrity, resulting in a highly efficient and scalable data model.

Time Series Analysis: Implemented a robust time series analysis framework by integrating a common date table using DAX functions such as CALENDARAUTO, MONTH, and RELATED. Established relationships between the fact table and the date table to enable precise temporal analysis.

Data Cleaning: Leveraged Power Query for extensive data cleaning and transformation, which included removing duplicates, correcting column data types, and handling missing values to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

DAX: Utilized DAX functions to create new columns and measures, enhancing data analysis capabilities and key performance indicators (KPIs). Conducted comparative analysis of sales across different years to uncover trends and patterns.

Visualization: Developed insightful visualizations to identify key patterns and trends, such as FY2018 emerging as the most profitable year and Quarter 1 being a pivotal period. These visualizations facilitate better understanding and decision-making for financial analysts.
